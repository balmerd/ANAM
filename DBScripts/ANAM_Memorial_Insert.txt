Robert Clancy was a highly decorated World War II Navy aviator who bombed and helped sink the Japanese super battleship Musashi off the Philippine Islands.</p><p>Cdr. Clancy was awarded the Navy Cross, the Navy''s second- highest military decoration, as well as the Silver Star the third-highest) and the Distinguished Flying Cross, for his bravery while flying the famed Helldiver carrier-based dive-bomber.</p><p>He was like thousands of other young men who volunteered for duty right after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Cdr. Clancy began training in January 1942 -- prospective flyers were first trained as civilian pilots -- and started training as a military pilot in August of that year.</p><p>By May 1943, he had received his wings, and after learning how to land on an aircraft carrier, he set sail for Hawaii on the carrier Yorktown in January 1944. He eventually ended up as a lieutenant junior grade on the Intrepid and flew the Curtiss SB2C Helldiver, a fast dive-bomber that would swoop in on an enemy, unload its bombs and streak away. It was not a job for the faint of heart or stomach.</p><p><span class="narrative">"The hell bombers would go down from 17,000 feet,"</span>recalled Dan Baker, 84, of Lafayette, and a fellow pilot with Cdr. Clancy on the Intrepid. <span class="narrative">"You''re flying the plane down and the targets were pretty big -- a battleship is about 800 feet long and 125 feet wide, and if you have a clear day it''s almost hard to miss. At about 9,000 feet, there''s a white carpet of anti-aircraft fire. You hope it doesn''t hit you."</span></p><p>Baker said that he and Cdr. Clancy and other aviators would zoom down from above and drop their bombs as their accompanying torpedo planes attacked horizontally at sea level.</p><p><span class="narrative">"When you pull out (of the dive bomb run), you “jink” the airplane, skidding the plane up and down so you don''t have a constant target as you''re pulling away,"</span> Baker said. <span class="narrative">"The battleships are shooting 17-inch guns into the water to create a big splash and try to knock you down. You get by the cruisers, you get by the destroyers, then run like hell and get out of there."</span></p><p>That was just the kind of thing Cdr. Clancy went through during the Battle of Leyte Gulf. In January 1945, the Fresno Bee wrote a story about his exploits over the Pacific in October 1944, during the thick of that bitter battle off the Philippines.</p><p><span class="narrative">"While the storm of flak rattled him around in his cockpit,"</span>the newspaper reported, <span class="narrative">"Clancy picked himself another battleship, pushed the Helldiver straight down and, while his tail gunner gazed straight up past his toes, watching for fighters, got the surface mammoth''s deck in his bombsight, set his flaps to slow him as much as possible and let the bomb go. He was at 1,800 feet when he pulled out of the screaming rush."</span></p><p><span class="narrative">"Striking the deck squarely, the armor piercing bomb slammed through and exploded in the battleship''s innards. Clancy''s gunner, looking down and back now as the bomber fought upward, clicked a camera shutter and got pictures of several bombs exploding as they hit the surface craft. The battleship slowed, stopped, floundered and sank."</span></p><p>Cdr. Clancy was one of many aviators credited with sinking the huge 65,000- ton battleship.</p><p><span class="narrative">"In this Battle of the Sibuyan Sea,"</span> according to the <a href="http://www.history.navy.mil/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline;">Naval Historical Center''s Web site</a>, <span class="narrative">the Musashi "was hit by some 19 torpedoes and 17 bombs. Though her heavy protection withstood this massive damage to a degree probably unsurpassed by any other contemporary warship, Musashi capsized and sank about four hours after she received her last hit."</span></p><p>Baker said Mr. Clancy was <span class="narrative">"an excellent pilot"</span> and used to have a favorite reply when somebody called him on the radio and asked where he was. Clancy would radio back, <span class="narrative">"I''m at 35,000 feet, flat on my back and going straight up."</span> Baker said he thought Clancy may have borrowed the line from a popular novel.</p><p>After the war, Cdr. Clancy returned to California, where he worked in sales for a division of the large medical manufacturing company Johnson & Johnson. He remained in the Naval Reserve, flying out of Alameda Naval Air Station until he retired in 1958, at the rank of Commander.</p></div>')

I believe she was in the service during WWII from 1944 to 1945/6. She was originally from Yakima, Washington. She passed away on Feb. 14, 2001 in Yakima and had a military burial. She was just shy of 90 years old. She was always proud of her service in the war.</p><p><i>--provided by her son, David F.

Orvis was from St. Augustine, Texas. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1953 and spent 30 years in the Navy advancing to Master Chief Petty Officer Store Keeper. After retiring from the Navy in 1983, he went to work in the 700 Department at the Naval Aviation Depot Alameda from 1985 to 1993. He transferred to North Island HSLWINGPAC, San Diego in 1993 due to the Alameda base closure. He performed as an IMRL Manager/Equipment Specialist until his death in October 2003.<p>Mr. Wade was one of the first "Special Assistants for Minority Affairs" in the US Navy.  This can be verified by reviewing the All Hands Magazine from April 1971, PG-18.  He was stationed at Norfolk at the time. I worked with Mr. Wade at COMHSLWINGPAC from 2000 until his death in 2003.</p><p><i>-- provided by <a href="mailto:michael.g.cook2@navy.mil">AFCM(AW) Michael G. Cook</a></i></p>')

He also worked at Alameda Naval Air Station. Retiring after 33 years of service. He was an active member of the Improved Benevolent Protective Order of Elks of the World.

In addition, he leaves behind Elector Williams and an extended family of aunts, uncles, sister-in-law, brothers-in-law, cousins, nieces, nephews, lodge brothers, sisters and friends who will miss him dearly.<p><i>-- published in the Bay Area News Group publication on 6/29/2008</i></p><p>I have been told that Tony Williams passed away on June 17th. He was a supervisor in bldg 530. I met Tony in 1978 in Norfolk, Va. while I was working in the Sidewinder missile shop. He was part of a workload transition team from Alameda. Sometime after that, a decision was made not to move the Sidewinder shop from Norfolk to Alameda. I spent the next two years trying to get a job in Alameda. Finally in August of 1980, I got the job and Tony was my supervisor. I was assigned to the Sparrow assembly area. Tony could be tough sometimes to work for. One day he called me to his desk and really got to me. So I went back to my work area and was cussing him out to my co-worker. Then from behind a locker, I heard Tony say "The shadow knows". We both laughed. Tony lived in Moraga, drove a Mercedes, wore nice suits, and smoked cigars. He would stand there sometimes with his cigar and say "I''m just a poor strugl''in minority", so he could watch the expressions on peoples faces. After I got in the apprentice program, I worked for Tony again for three months. He treated me with respect and gave me praise on my evaluation. The last time I saw Tony was at the Amtrak station in Oakland where he worked part time. We didn''t always get along, but I liked Tony and I am really sad to hear he is gone.</p><p><i>-- provided by <a href="mailto:alvinaman@gmail.com">Alvin</a></i></p>')
