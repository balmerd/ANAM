Robert Clancy was a highly decorated World War II Navy aviator who bombed and helped sink the Japanese super battleship Musashi off the Philippine Islands.</p><p>Cdr. Clancy was awarded the Navy Cross, the Navy''s second- highest military decoration, as well as the Silver Star the third-highest) and the Distinguished Flying Cross, for his bravery while flying the famed Helldiver carrier-based dive-bomber.</p><p>He was like thousands of other young men who volunteered for duty right after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Cdr. Clancy began training in January 1942 -- prospective flyers were first trained as civilian pilots -- and started training as a military pilot in August of that year.</p><p>By May 1943, he had received his wings, and after learning how to land on an aircraft carrier, he set sail for Hawaii on the carrier Yorktown in January 1944. He eventually ended up as a lieutenant junior grade on the Intrepid and flew the Curtiss SB2C Helldiver, a fast dive-bomber that would swoop in on an enemy, unload its bombs and streak away. It was not a job for the faint of heart or stomach.</p><p><span class="narrative">"The hell bombers would go down from 17,000 feet,"</span>recalled Dan Baker, 84, of Lafayette, and a fellow pilot with Cdr. Clancy on the Intrepid. <span class="narrative">"You''re flying the plane down and the targets were pretty big -- a battleship is about 800 feet long and 125 feet wide, and if you have a clear day it''s almost hard to miss. At about 9,000 feet, there''s a white carpet of anti-aircraft fire. You hope it doesn''t hit you."</span></p><p>Baker said that he and Cdr. Clancy and other aviators would zoom down from above and drop their bombs as their accompanying torpedo planes attacked horizontally at sea level.</p><p><span class="narrative">"When you pull out (of the dive bomb run), you “jink” the airplane, skidding the plane up and down so you don''t have a constant target as you''re pulling away,"</span> Baker said. <span class="narrative">"The battleships are shooting 17-inch guns into the water to create a big splash and try to knock you down. You get by the cruisers, you get by the destroyers, then run like hell and get out of there."</span></p><p>That was just the kind of thing Cdr. Clancy went through during the Battle of Leyte Gulf. In January 1945, the Fresno Bee wrote a story about his exploits over the Pacific in October 1944, during the thick of that bitter battle off the Philippines.</p><p><span class="narrative">"While the storm of flak rattled him around in his cockpit,"</span>the newspaper reported, <span class="narrative">"Clancy picked himself another battleship, pushed the Helldiver straight down and, while his tail gunner gazed straight up past his toes, watching for fighters, got the surface mammoth''s deck in his bombsight, set his flaps to slow him as much as possible and let the bomb go. He was at 1,800 feet when he pulled out of the screaming rush."</span></p><p><span class="narrative">"Striking the deck squarely, the armor piercing bomb slammed through and exploded in the battleship''s innards. Clancy''s gunner, looking down and back now as the bomber fought upward, clicked a camera shutter and got pictures of several bombs exploding as they hit the surface craft. The battleship slowed, stopped, floundered and sank."</span></p><p>Cdr. Clancy was one of many aviators credited with sinking the huge 65,000- ton battleship.</p><p><span class="narrative">"In this Battle of the Sibuyan Sea,"</span> according to the <a href="http://www.history.navy.mil/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline;">Naval Historical Center''s Web site</a>, <span class="narrative">the Musashi "was hit by some 19 torpedoes and 17 bombs. Though her heavy protection withstood this massive damage to a degree probably unsurpassed by any other contemporary warship, Musashi capsized and sank about four hours after she received her last hit."</span></p><p>Baker said Mr. Clancy was <span class="narrative">"an excellent pilot"</span> and used to have a favorite reply when somebody called him on the radio and asked where he was. Clancy would radio back, <span class="narrative">"I''m at 35,000 feet, flat on my back and going straight up."</span> Baker said he thought Clancy may have borrowed the line from a popular novel.</p><p>After the war, Cdr. Clancy returned to California, where he worked in sales for a division of the large medical manufacturing company Johnson & Johnson. He remained in the Naval Reserve, flying out of Alameda Naval Air Station until he retired in 1958, at the rank of Commander.</p></div>' )

He was a supervisor in bldg 530. I met Tony in 1978 in Norfolk, Va. while I was working in the Sidewinder missile shop. He was part of a workload transition team from Alameda. Sometime after that, a decision was made not to move the Sidewinder shop from Norfolk to Alameda. I spent the next two years trying to get a job in Alameda. Finally in August of 1980, I got the job and Tony was my supervisor. I was assigned to the Sparrow assembly area. Tony could be tough sometimes to work for. One day he called me to his desk and really got to me. So I went back to my work area and was cussing him out to my co-worker. Then from behind a locker, I heard Tony say "The shadow knows". We both laughed. Tony lived in Moraga, drove a Mercedes, wore nice suits, and smoked cigars. He would stand there sometimes with his cigar and say "I''m just a poor strugl''in minority", so he could watch the expressions on peoples faces. After I got in the apprentice program, I worked for Tony again for three months. He treated me with respect and gave me praise on my evaluation. The last time I saw Tony was at the Amtrak station in Oakland where he worked part time. We didn''t always get along, but I liked Tony and I am really sad to hear he is gone.</p><p><i>-- provided by <a href="mailto:alvinaman@gmail.com">Alvin</a></i></p>' )

Sillers (Jan. 12, 1949 - Apr. 7, 2009) worked in Production Control on the 3rd deck of Bldg 400.</p> <p>David D. Sillers died peacefully on April 7, 2009 in Alameda''s Bay View Nursing & Rehab Center. Dave was born on January 12, 1949 and was a long-time resident of Alameda, graduating from Alameda High School in 1967.</p> <p>At AHS Dave will be remembered as the only student who received a spontaneous burst of applause at graduation, starting with the 471 graduates, and welling up until everyone in the auditorium was clapping and cheering. It was a sincere tribute by his fellow graduates to a student for an achievement that did not appear on the printed listing of scholastic accomplishments. It was the student recognition -- unrehearsed and unorganized -- of something they thought was pretty wonderful. The applause kept growing as Dave accepted his diploma. The hand clapping continued as he climbed down the stairs from the stage, and it did not stop until Dave walked up the aisle and returned to his seat. The story behind the student admiration of Dave began three years earlier in 1964 when, as a popular freshman athlete, he was fighting for his life after an accident that left him severely paralyzed. Determined to let nothing stop him, he applied himself to a home study program outlined by his teachers. Eventually he was able to use a wheel chair. Then, he was able to walk -- very slowly at first, and then with a limp. Gradually he learned to re-use his arms and hands and eventually he began to attend classes on a part-time basis and then finally after more than a year, he became a regular student at AHS once again.</p> <p>So, when he received his diploma that graduation night 43 years ago, it was like running a kick-off back for the winning touchdown, hitting a grand slam home run in the final inning, or scoring the winning basket in the sudden-death overtime. The heart-warming hand clapping of his 471 fellow students, their families and friends meant much more than the wild cheering of the biggest rooting section. Dave, who might have been one of Alameda High''s great athletes if things had been different, proved he already had what high school sports are supposed to teach - courage, determination, and strength.</p> <p>The things he learned at AHS followed Dave through the rest of his life in Alameda. Dave continued to grow and be involved in things beyond just himself. Dave went to San Francisco State University, graduating with a bachelor''s of arts degree in 1974. Soon after college Dave joined and then became an officer of the Alameda JayCee''s where he met some of his life long friends. He was appointed as a commissioner for the Alameda Parks & Recreation District serving for many years. Dave was well known and did outstanding service work for Alameda and as a result was selected as one of the "Outstanding Young Men of America." For the past six years Dave has been living in Alameda''s Bay View Nursing & Rehab Center, since in 2002, he was hit by a car while crossing the street in a crosswalk near his home. This second accident left Dave completely bed-bound as he was nearly completely paralyzed except for his head and right arm.</p> <p>Dave''s mother and father were an incredible support to him during his entire lifetime. They were an integral part of Dave''s adult life as he was included in all their activities, parties and trips. However, his mother, Wilhelmine Sillers, passed away two years ago and his father, CDR. Colin B. Sillers, USN (ret''d), passed away 4 months ago. Dave greatly missed both his parents after their passing, especially his Dad as he was the person who visited Dave every single day while he lived at Bay View Nursing & Rehab Center. Dave is survived by his brother, Bruce (Coby) Sillers, Jr. of Atlanta, GA, his nephew, Doug Sillers of Santa Barbara, CA and his niece, Katy Sillers Krippaehne of Tacoma, WA.</p> ' )
