    On November 22, 1935, over 25,000 spectators lined the shore of Pan American Airways' (PAA) base at Alameda, CA, to watch as the 
    China Clipper eased away from its mooring to begin the dangerous transpacific flight. The engines of the silver Martin <nobr>M-130</nobr> 
    flying boat roared as her pilot, renowned PAA aviator Capt. Edwin Musick, coaxed the heavy aircraft up from San Francisco Bay bound for 
    Manila, via Honolulu, Midway, Wake Island, and Guam. The inaugural <nobr>8,200</nobr>-mile journey, delivering U.S. Air Mail run, including 
    personal letters to the president of the Philippines from Franklin D. Roosevelt, was completed some 59 hours after passing over the Golden 
    Gate. The world listened intently to international radio broadcasts that covered every detail of the dangerous flight as it made its way 
    across the Pacific Ocean.

On Sunday, November 21, 2010, the Alameda Naval Air Museum commemorated the inaugural flight of China Clipper with a living history 
<nobr>re-enactment</nobr> of the actual 1935 event. Featuring a simulated radio broadcast, complete with live <nobr>re-enactors</nobr> 
portraying the actual participants and dignitaries, plus vintage vehicles, and more.
</p>

<p>Those in attendance had a rare opportunity to turn back the clock and participate in what was a significant event in world and aviation history. 
The museum also opened its new China Clipper exhibit to the public as part of the event.
