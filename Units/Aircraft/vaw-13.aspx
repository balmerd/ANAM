	<p>VAW-13 was born on Agana, Guam September 1, 1959. The planes assigned to the squadron were AD-5Q and AD-5W Sky Raiders, referred to by squadron 
	personnel as "Queens". The designation was changed several years later to EA-1F. The Tail Code was V R "Victor Romeo" and the call sign on the UHF Radio 
	was "Robinson". The Squadron was known as the "Zappers" and the Green Dragon with Lighting Bolts became the Squadron Patch.</p>

	<p>The Squadron operated out of Guam until they were re-assigned stateside to NAS Alameda, Calif. July 22, 1961. In June and July of 1961, members and 
	planes from VAW-11 Stationed at NAS North Island, Calif prepared for transfer to VAW-13. All AD 5 Q's from VAW-11 along with the support group and pilots 
	were then transferred to VAW-13 arriving in July & August of 1961.</p>

	<p>VAW-13 took on the full time duty of an Electronic Warfare (ECM) Squadron and VAW-11 became a fulltime <nobr>Anti-Submarine</nobr> Squadron.</p>

	<p>VAW-13 supplied a minimum of two planes and support personnel to every Aircraft Carrier that deployed to Westpac for the next several years.</p>

	<p>A Detachment at NAS Cubi Point, PI was maintained by VAW-13 from April/May of 1962.This Detachment was known as Det.One.</p>

	<p>On September 30, 1968 VAW-13 and its Sky Raiders passed into the Naval History books as one of the last great propeller Squadrons to serve in the US NAVY 
	but the love of the plane and all its personnel live on.</p>

	<p>On October 1, 1968 <a href="vaq-130.aspx">VAQ-130</a> was born out of the men and women from VAW-13 and live on to this day. This is another story for 
	other Sailors to tell.</p>
