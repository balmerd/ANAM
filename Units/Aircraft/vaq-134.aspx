	<p>VAQ-134 was originally commissioned on 7 June 1969 at NAS Alameda, California as the GARUDAS.  Based on an old Hindu myth, the Garuda is the bird that took 
	Wisnu, the God of War, wherever necessary in his quest to protect God's creation from those evil forces that sought to upset and destroy it.  The Garudas, 
	flying the EA-3B "Skywarriors," won the Pacific Fleet Battle "E" for combat efficiency in 1969 and 1971.</p>
	
	<p>After decommissioning in late 1971, the Garudas were reactivated as an EA-6B "Prowler" squadron in 1972 as the third Navy Prowler squadron, and moved their 
	homeport to NAS Whidbey Island, Washington.  Assigned to USS CONSTELLATION (CV 64) with Carrier Air Wing NINE, they embarked on their first deployment with 
	the new EA-6Bs to the Western Pacific (WESTPAC) on 5 January 1973, just prior to the termination of hostilities in Vietnam.  Upon their return in October 
	1973, the squadron transitioned to the Expanded Capability (EXCAP) version of the EA-6B.</p>
