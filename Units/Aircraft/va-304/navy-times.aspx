	<p>The VA-304 Public Affairs Office took the original from the Navy Times Newspaper and blew it up and made copies for everyone in the squadron. They were included with the monthly Plan-of-the-Day, when it was mailed out.</p>
	<p>There were a few that were posted on the bulkhead, topside in the squadron hanger. This is one of those, since its not folded or full of staple holes.</p>
