	<p>VAQ-131 came into existence on 1 November 1968 when VAH-4 was re-designated.  Homeport for the new TACELRON was NAS Alameda, California.  
	The mission of VAQ-131 was to conduct electronic warfare and to provide air-to-air refueling in support of Attack Carrier Task Force operations.  
	In conducting this mission, VAQ-131 utilized KA / EKA-3B models of the Douglas A-3 "Skywarrior" aircraft.  The new TACELRON deployed their Skywarriors to the 
	Gulf of Tonkin aboard the USS Kitty Hawk (CVA-63) with CDR T. L. Jackson as their first CO.</p>
	
	<p>In September 1970, with CDR S.M. Corey, Commanding, the squadron was in a period of training preparing for an impending deployment.  VAQ-131 was aboard the 
	U.S.S. John F. Kennedy (CVA-67) as a member of Attack Carrier Air Wing One (CVW-1) preparing to undergo an Operational Readiness Inspection (ORI) when due to 
	the Mid-East Crisis the ship was directed to proceed immediately to the Mediterranean.</p>
	
	<p>For participation in this crisis, the U.S.S. John F. Kennedy and her embarked Air Wing (CVW-1) were awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation.</p>
	<p>	VAQ-131 ended its 1970-71 deployment, with the squadron returning to it's home port of Alameda, California, on 28 February 1971.  The squadron then 
	commenced stand-down in preparation to transition to the EA-6B aircraft community home ported at NAS Whidbey Island, Washington.</p>
