		<div class="bd">
			<div>
				The Carrier blog is your gateway to the stories behind the Alameda Naval Air Station and Alameda Point.<br /><br />
				<i>"The roar of aircraft engines, silhouettes of naval vessels on the horizon, and the ubiquitous presence of uniformed personnel, were all part of life in 
				Alameda between 1930 and 1997. For several decades I experienced all of these things firsthand as a resident of the Island City. In the relatively short period 
				since the base closure in 1997, I find that fewer and fewer people recall what those times were like. Even fewer know the remarkable aviation legacy of Alameda 
				Point before the opening of NAS Alameda in 1940.<br /><br />
				I hope this blog, named after the original base newsletter, will provide a better understanding of the rich history associated with Alameda’s West End."
