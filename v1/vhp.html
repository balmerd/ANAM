<p><b><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>The Alameda Naval Air Museum has been designated an 
official Partner Archive for the national Veterans History Project by the Library of Congress.  The purpose of the Veterans 
History Project is to document and permanently archive the wartime service experiences of veterans and civil workers. 
<br>
<br>
As an official archive for the Project, the Museum will conduct videotaped interviews, and collect memoirs, personal 
artifacts, and other original materials from veterans of World War II, the Korean, Vietnam, and Persian Gulf Wars and the 
Afghanistan and Iraq conflicts for preservation in Washington, D.C.. The museum has also expanded the scope of subjects to 
include those who served and worked at the Alameda Naval Air Station at anytime during its operation between 1940 and 1997.  
In addition, members of the local community are asked to share their own remembrances of the base or family members who 
served.  Archival materials are also welcome.
<br>
<br>
“As a veteran of World War II, I understand the urgency of the Veterans History Project. Most of us are in our 80’s now. 
The reality is we won’t be around much longer to tell the story of our wartime service,” said Marilyn York, Museum Director. 
“Many young people don’t understand the tremendous sacrifices that were made by their own grandparents and relatives.  It’s 
critical that we act now to preserve the lessons of history for future generations of Americans.”
<br>
<br>
Service veterans and those U.S. citizen civilians who were actively involved in supporting war efforts  (such as war industry
workers, USO workers, flight instructors, medical volunteers, etc.) are encouraged to contribute their personal narratives.  
For more information or to schedule an interview, please contact Kin Robles, ANAM Media Coordinator at 925-759-2090. 
Interviews are normally conducted during the museums normal hours of operation: Saturday and Sunday from 10:00 a.m. to 
4:00 p.m. Special appointments and arrangement for transportation can be made upon request. 
<br>
<br>
Interested parties should print the VHP Biographical Data Form, below and return it to the Alameda Naval Air Museum prior 
to their interview.
