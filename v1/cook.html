<p><b><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>
Command Master Chief Jerry T. Cook joined the Navy in 1960 at the age of 20.  He went through Boot Camp in San Diego, California and then 
was selected to attend Aviation Electronic Technician (AT"A") School in Memphis, Tennessee.
<br>
<br>  
Starting out as an aviation electronic technician, AT Cook served in numerous squadrons including VA123, VAH2, FAETUPAC and VAQ136 at NAS 
Whidbey Island in Oak Harbor, Washington; VAW132, VAQ132, NAMTD 1073 (A3), and NARU at NAS Alameda, California; NWC China Lake in China Lake, California; 
NAS Lajes Field in the Azores, Portugal, and his final duty station, before retirement, in VT21 at NAS Kingsville, Texas.
<br>
<br>
He served on many ships including the USS Independence, USS Kitty Hawk and the USS Enterprise, helping in the rescue efforts during the 
devastating  USS Enterprise fire in 1969.  He took great pride in the men he worked with and asked them for their best.  They responded, 
honoring him with a handmade plaque that read “JC’s AT's  - The impossible we do with a smile. Miracles take a little while”.
<br>
<br>
Upon retirement at NAS Kingsville after 28 years of service in 1987, he took some time off to travel around the country before settling in 
Sedro Woolley, Washington where he started a business with his wife.
