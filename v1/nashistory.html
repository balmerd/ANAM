<p><b><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>The Alameda Naval Air Station has a remarkable history.  It
was one of the largest, most complete Naval Air Stations in the world.  It was commissioned on November 1, 1940
and commanded by Captain Frank McCrary. There were 200 military and civilian personnel.
<br>
<br>
The workers at the Naval Air Station represented 271 separate and distinct trades and could manufacture and 
repair every part of any aircraft.  In time, modern production methods insured that the overhaul of an attack 
aircraft was completed every day and one and half patrol aircraft every other day.
<br>
<br>
The base was once part of an Indian burial ground.  The base was originally part of a Spanish land grant of Don
Luis Maria Peralta.  In 1864, the terminus of the first transcontinental railroad ended at Pier 2 at the old 
Alameda Point. Old Alameda Point was in the confines of what became the Alameda Naval Air Station.  An oil
refinery was built in 1879 and was purchased by Standard Oil.  It operated until 1903.  The site of the Engine
Overhaul Building was used as the Pacific Borax Works.
<br>
<br>
The City of Alameda saw the possibility for a Naval Base on the west end of the island of Alameda.  In 1936,
Congress authorized Franklin Delano Roosevelt to accept the old Alameda Point for the purchase price of $1.00.
<br>
<br>
The Alameda Naval Air Station was created just in time for World War II.  The original site was 300 acres of
high ground. Note: When the station closed in 1997 the total area was 2,527 acres or one-third of the island
of Alameda.
<br>
<br>
Dredging operations began in 1938 and the air station grew almost overnight. In January 1943, the Assembly and 
Repair Department (A&R) received its first assignment. One Curtis Sea Gull (SOC) aircraft was the first one 
overhauled. On December 7, 1941 the A&R employed 1,935 personnel and repaired 14 aircraft a month. In 1958 
O&R produced 1,305 jet engines and 881 reciprocating engines.
<br>
<br>
Carriers based at Naval Air Station Alameda included USS Ranger, USS Midway, USS Coral Sea and USS Hancock. All called 
Alameda home.
<br>
<br>
NAS Alameda had two 8,000 ft. runways, three seaplane ramps and a lighted seadrome. The air station had 300
buildings and 30 miles of roads.
<br>
<br>
The Navy was deeply involved in the history, traditions and culture of California, so too, was it bound to
economics with this region so popular with seafaring men.
<br>
<br>
The Alameda Naval Air Museum wishes to preserve for posterity artifacts, photographs, memorabilia and education
materials connected to the air station. Many volunteers are working to collect and fund a lasting collection
which will be preserved for future generations.  The museum is located in the Air terminal in Building 77 and
we will begin building exhibits soon.
