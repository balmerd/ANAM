<center><b>Captain Stuart Corey, USN Ret.</center>

<p><b><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>
Captain Stuart Corey, born and raised in Washington State, was a pilot before he was a licensed driver.  His love of flying took him into the U. S. Navy in 1951 and he commenced flight training as a Naval Aviation Cadet in 1953.  He received his commission as an Ensign and was designated a Naval Aviator in January of 1955. 
<br>
<br>
His career in the military was a successful one in which he fought in the Korean and Vietnam wars, and was one man away from getting into the Space program.  He flew from every aircraft carrier the Navy had during the 50's, 60's and 70's.
<br>
<br>
Captain Corey served in many commands and in 1971 assumed command of Tactical Electronics Warfare Squadron 131 ( VAQ-131 ) at NAS Alameda.  His final duty station was at NAS Whidbey, in 1976, where he became the XO of the base.
<br>
<br>
Stuart retired with the rank of Captain in 1978.
