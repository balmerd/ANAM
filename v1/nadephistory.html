<p><b><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>The Naval Air Rework Facility (NARF) Alameda was 
a professional organization dedicated to the technology demands of maintaining the fleet in readiness. NARF Alameda
was the largest industry in the East Bay area and was proud of it's reputation. At it's peak in 1945, there were over 
9,500 civilian employees. 
<br>
<br>
The number of fleet aircraft had increased a thousand fold since World War II. Additionally, Anti-Submarine Warfare
(ASW) had moved more and more into the arena.  From the bottom of the sea to the cold vacuum of outer space, the 
responsibiity for the defense of the West became a herculean effort. NARF Alameda kept our resources in ready condition.
<br>
<br>
In time, the NARF workload became even more focused on Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) operational readiness.
The facility reduced the time that vital ASW aircraft engines and related systems were out of action for required
rework.  Eventually, ASW would comprise more than half of NARF Alameda's workload. The rest of the workload was broken
down as follows:
<br>
<br>
One third - Repair and rework of A3 "Skywarrior", A6 "Intruder", S3 "Viking" and P3 "Orion aircraft.
<br>
<br>
One tenth - Repair and rework of J52, 501K, T56 and TF34 aircraft engines.
<br>
<br>
One third - Repair and rework of aircraft components, avionics systems and engine accessories.
<br>
<br>
One twentieth - Repair and rework of Sparrow, Phoenix and Shrike missiles.
<br>
<br>
NARF Alameda employed 237 separate trades which were capable of manufacturing any needed aircraft part. Specialized
facilties, within the complex, were a foundry, pattern shop, plating shop, parachute loft, clean rooms and machine
shops. Extensive paint stripping, paint shops, and weapons testing areas were also available.
<br>
<br>
These capabilities were deveoped early in World War II and strengthened over three suceeding decades and three
generations of workers. NARF Alameda was noted for it's "can-do" spirit and it's production record was respected
by the fleet which placed safety of flight above all else. NARF Alameda was proud of it's products. 
<br>
<br>
The Naval Air Rework Facility (NARF) Alameda was closed in 1997 as directed by the Base Realignment
and Closure (BRAC) Act of 1990.
