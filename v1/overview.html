<p><b><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>The historic legacy of the Alameda Naval Air Station
will be preserved at the Alameda Naval Air Museum located in the former Air Terminal Building #77 at Alameda Point.
Our museum will feature archival materials, photographs and stories of the war workers of World War II up to the 
eventual closing of the base in 1997. 
<br>
<br>
This project was made possible by a grant for building upgrades from the Economic Development Agency and the city
of Alameda.  To date, some $750,000 worth of improvements have been made to Building #77 to meet all code 
requirements of the City of Alameda.
<br>
<br>
Volunteers established the Alameda Naval Air Museum as an educational community center which will tell the story
of it's beginnings in support of the Pacific Fleet in World War II and it's subsequent decades of service to the 
nation during Korea, Vietnam and Desert Storm.  
<br>
<br>
Visitors will be able to read historic newspapers published at Pearl Harbor.  You will have an opportunity to 
re-live the past.  That is what history is all about. We are interested in acquiring and preserving documents that
illustrate and celebrate the people and stories of the World War II years.  Our collection will include artifacts,
photographs, aircraft models, programs, guide books, flyers, documents, safety gear, medals, uniforms, badges and
awards. 
<br>
<br>
The purpose of our museum is to preserve for the benefit and inspiration of future generations and to leave a 
historic legacy.
<br>
<br>
Society and industry were changed forever by the sweeping impacts of the World War II build-up.  For the first 
time, men, women and minorities worked together side by side.  Services such as health insurance and child care
were initiated in industry to improve worker's health, productivity and retention.  Labor and government worked
together to provide to the fleet overhauled aircraft and engines achieving unheard of production records.
<br>
<br>
People moved here from all over the country in unprecedented numbers to seek industrial production jobs.  This
changed rural and urban America forever.  The Air Station had 45,000 personnel at its peak in 1945 when the city
of Alameda had only 25,000 residents.  The base covered one-third of the island of Alameda.
<br>
<br>
The museum volunteers look forward to hosting many visits of school children so they can learn about Naval Aviation
history and the valuable contributions made by the many generations of workers during the last half of the 20th 
Century.  More than 250 skilled trades came together at NAS Alameda to create lasting records of top workmanship
and professionalism.
