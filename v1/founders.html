<b><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Our vision is to build ANAM into the 
leading museum of its kind on the West Coast. This is no small task, but certainly no pipedream either.  In October we signed
a ten-year lease with the City of Alameda to continue museum operations in Building 77 at Alameda Point. This was the 
critical next step toward achieving our vision. As important as this milestone was, we can't lose sight of the fact that 
this is only the next step. Many more lie ahead on the path to long-term success</b>
<br>
<br>


<b>To be a leading museum we'll need more of the hard work, determination and tenacity that has been the hallmark of our 
first eighteen months of operation. We'll need higher levels of funding, the lifeblood of any non-profit organization. 
We'll need significant growth in our base membership.  New members will bring the additional skill sets and innovation we 
need to implement the many programs that will serve our local community and the country as a whole.  Finally, and most 
importantly, we'll need to follow our long-term plan that carefully outlines what must be accomplished for the museum to 
develop, grow and measure success. Each of these is critical if we hope to achieve our vision and goals. </b>
<br>
<br>

<b>When the museum shut its doors with the closure of NAS Alameda in 1997, those of us who had a role in its inception 
doubted whether they would ever open again. It's been a long road full of seemingly insurmountable challenges. But we 
did it! It is with tremendous pride that I proclaim ANAM is back! Never to close her doors on the community she serves 
again. 
</b>
<br>
<br>

<b>I want to thank all of the countless individuals who played a role in our rebirth. So many of you have given generously 
of your time and money to get us where we are today.  Very special thanks go out to the Board of Directors and our Staff. 
You have accomplished so much. I am proud to have you at my side as together we preserve the history of NAS Alameda and her 
predecessors, aviation pioneers and the brave men and women who have served their country at Alameda Point.
